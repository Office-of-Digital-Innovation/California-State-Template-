<h2>Use policy</h2>

<p><a id="choice"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">PERSONAL
 INFORMATION AND CHOICE</h3>
<p>“Personal information” is information about a natural person that identifies or describes an
 individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical
 description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or
 employment history, readily identifiable to that specific individual. A domain name or Internet
 Protocol address is not considered personal information, however, it is considered “electronically
 collected personal information.”</p>
<p>According to Government Code § 11015.5., “electronically collected personal information” means any
 information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual user,
 including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home
 address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history,
 password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity,
 but excludes any information manually submitted to a State agency by a user, whether electronically
 or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a
 business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that
 business.</p>
<p>“Electronically collected personal information” that we automatically collect includes your domain
 name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical information about which web pages you visit. If
 you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e., completing a
 request for assistance, personalizing the content of the web site, sending an e-mail, or
 participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in
 these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the web
 site.</p>
<p>If any type of personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, State
 law, including the Information Practices Act of 1977, Government Code Section 11015.5., and the
 federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information may be a public record once
 you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by
 federal or State law.</p>
<p>Additionally, departments and agencies of the State of California under the authority of the Governor
 are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy which is also accessible on this web site.</p>
<p><a id="children"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">A
 SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN</h3>
<p>Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information, and we
 require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. This
 includes submitting personal information to the State as part of a user profile or personalization
 profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or
 guardians. If you are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.</p>
<p>If the State decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents
 that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use of
 it. The State will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information.
 If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view
 their child’s information, and, if they choose, prohibit the State from making further use of their
 child’s information. The State will not provide personal information about children to third
 parties.</p>
<p><a id="info"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">
 INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED</h3>
<p>We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to use some of our
 services. Collection of this information is required to deliver the specific services, but use of
 these services is voluntary.</p>
<p>The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our web services
 and to help us understand how people are using our services. This information does not identify you
 personally and is used for gathering web site statistics. The information we automatically collect
 and store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our web site to continually improve the
 value of the materials available. Our web site logs do not identify a visitor by personal
 information, and we make no attempt to link other web sites with the individuals that browse the
 State’s web site.</p>
<p>Government Code § 11015.5.(a)(6) prohibits all state agencies from distributing or selling any
 electronically collected personal information, as defined above, about users to any third party
 without the permission of the user. The State does not sell any “electronically collected personal
 information.” Any distribution of “electronically collected personal information” will be solely for
 the purposes for which it was provided to us.</p>
<p>The State may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information
 as provided by law, but no personal information is sold or distributed, and all relevant legal
 protections still apply to the State’s web sites.</p>
<p><a id="submit"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">WHAT
 HAPPENS TO INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US?</h3>
<p>If you choose to submit information to us, the information will be transmitted through secure lines
 to our departmental database. Any private information will only be used for the purposes for which
 it was provided and will not be shared with another entity except as prescribed by law. Please see
 our Privacy Policy for additional information.</p>
<p><a id="form"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">USE OF
 INTERNET REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FORM INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Any information you provide to us will only be shared with entities involved in your case as
 necessary. Information you provide may be included with other consumers’ information to be used for
 statistical reporting, trending data, and/or investigative actions. For example, we may need to
 retain information that becomes part of an enforcement action or consumer complaint case for a
 period of time after the closing date of the case.</p>
<p>If you provide us with information regarding an issue that does not fall within our regulatory
 jurisdiction, we may refer your information to the appropriate local, State, or federal agency on
 your behalf.</p>
<p><a id="surveys"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">SURVEYS
</h3>
<p>If during your visit to the State’s web site you participate in a survey or send an e-mail, the
 following additional information will be collected:</p>
<ol style="color: #222222; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 40px;">
 <li>The e-mail address and contents of the e-mail; and</li>
 <li>Information volunteered in response to the survey.</li>
</ol>
<p>The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic
 information formats you send us.</p>
<p>The information is retained in accordance with Government Code § 11015.5.</p>
<p><a id="email"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">IF YOU
 SEND US E-MAIL</h3>
<p>You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with a comment or question. We
 use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we
 forward your e-mail to other State employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may
 be employed by a different agency within the State. Except for authorized law enforcement
 investigations or, as required by law, we do not share our e-mail with any other organizations.</p>
<p>We use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you
 identify, to further improve our web site, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for
 appropriate action.</p>
<p><a id="disclose" style="color: #1f70a7;"></a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">PUBLIC
 DISCLOSURE</h3>
<p>In the State of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a
 right to access appropriate records and information possessed by State government. At the same time,
 there are exceptions to the public’s right to access public records. These exceptions serve various
 needs including maintaining the privacy of individuals. Both State and federal laws provide
 exceptions.</p>
<p>All information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and
 copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. In the event of a conflict between this
 Use Policy and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other law governing the
 disclosure of records, the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other applicable
 law will control.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #bcbcbc;">PERSONAL
